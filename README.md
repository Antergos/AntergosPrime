# AntergosPrime

### This collection of scripts wants to provide GPU-switching for Hybrid-GPUs like in \*buntu-distributions.

This branch is a fork of emanuellopes's archLinuxPrime [archLinuxPrime](https://github.com/emanuellopes/archLinuxPrime) which got optimized for the Antergos distribution. Emanuellopes forked for his repo the prime application that comes on Linux Mint.

Even if this branch is made for Antergos, the installation-instructions are mostly system-independent and should therefore work with any Arch-distribution.
